        <h1>Cross-chain DeFi from Intent and Chain Abstraction Perspective</h1>
<p>Cross-chain DeFi is one of the major topics in DeFi, with great potential for enhancing user experience and decentralization. It often involves bridging and swapping between compatible and non-compatible chains. I will describe the categories of &quot;Cross-chain DeFi&quot; and how contemporary players have improved the experience, with specific examples.</p>
<h2>Why do we need Cross-chain DeFi, Interoperability, or Chain Abstraction?</h2>
<p>Cross-chain DeFi is an important topic in DeFi for growing the decentralized ecosystem. The world will remain centralized unless we strive to enhance the entire cross-chain experience. The current world already possesses the knowledge and technology, including sophisticated centralized databases, that prioritize profit maximization over transparency.</p>
<p>Without cross-chain DeFi, people have to use centralized exchanges to swap or bridge their assets. This means people have to trust third parties when they want to exchange their assets, so we need more options to exchange our assets across chains.</p>
<h2>3 Types of Approaches for Cross-chain DeFi</h2>
<p>Cross-chain DeFi is a subset of DeFi but with a more abstract focus, often referred to as a use case in DeFi, intent, or improving the cross-chain DeFi experience regardless of the layer.</p>
<p>We can recognize Cross-chain DeFi as an abstract topic. Founders usually do not define their products as Cross-chain DeFi products because their products are more generalized solutions to cross-chain experience problems.</p>
<p>In this article, we categorize Cross-chain DeFi products into three types: Application Layer, Permission Layer, and Protocol Layer.</p>
<p><strong>Application Layer:</strong> This includes DEXs and aggregators such as Li.Fi, Rango and Squid. They provide Cross-chain DeFi experiences by utilizing or combining protocols.</p>
<p><strong>Permission Layer:</strong> Wallets and accounts. They enhance the overall cross-chain experience, particularly in the context of Account Abstraction.</p>
<p><strong>Protocol Layer:</strong> Messaging, relayers, and infrastructure. They improve the cross-chain experience through abstracted approaches. However, these solutions often require time to design and verify, meaning crypto users may have to wait six months or more to experience new approaches.</p>

<h2>What are the current challenges or pain points with cross-chain DeFi?</h2>
<p>The Cross-chain DeFi market faces two crucial challenges: first, adapting to the era of millions of rollups post-Dencun upgrade; second, managing cross-chain liquidity in a decentralized manner.</p>
<p>Adapting to the era of millions of rollups is a crucial topic. Rollups have improved user experience by reducing gas fees and speeding up transactions, but users must bridge when they want to use other chains, making it difficult for them to accurately recognize their own assets. The Application Layer and Permission Layer can adapt to this problem relatively easily, but the Protocol Layer faces difficulties in supporting numerous rollups, as it would require deploying thousands of contracts, leading to liquidity fragmentation.</p>
<p>Liquidity fragmentation is also a critical issue concerning liquidity provider revenue and user bridge costs. Liquidity fragmentation can lead to monopolization in specific bridging cases and swapping routes because the number of relayers is limited, allowing them to propose bridge fees without much competition, which increases user costs. Protocols using the relayer model can provide rapid bridging experiences but depend on the relayer&#39;s stock.</p>
<h2>Is Bridge Enough?</h2>
<p>Bridges serve as interfaces for users, but they are provided in various ways. I will introduce some types of bridges and their features. Li.Fi introduced a category of bridges in their blog. Here is an image of &quot;The Trust Spectrum in Bridges&quot; from their blog. (<a href="https://blog.li.fi/li-fi-with-bridges-trust-is-a-spectrum-354cd5a1a6d8">https://blog.li.fi/li-fi-with-bridges-trust-is-a-spectrum-354cd5a1a6d8</a>)</p>
<p><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rykDu3EoR.png" alt="bridge-category" class="responsive-img"></p>
<p>There are many bridges in each ecosystem, but users often don&#39;t know how they support chains. Aggregators like Li.Fi and Rango enhance the user experience when users are unfamiliar with the frontend. Aggregators have improved the user experience for finding suitable routes, but their solution is not the best from a fee perspective, as they sometimes suggest two or three transactions to fulfill a user&#39;s intent. The current ecosystem is sufficient to provide the best route but insufficient in terms of fees.</p>
<h2>What is The Difference between Cross-chain DeFi and Chain Abstraction?</h2>
<p>Cross-chain DeFi is a use case that arises from Chain Abstraction and other narratives. The most important aspect of Cross-chain DeFi is how to build it using the appropriate infrastructure. Whether people trust humans or code, they need a good experience, such as rapid swaps and bridges with low fees, but most users cannot verify how it works.</p>
<p>Chain Abstraction has the potential to enable faster swaps and bridges with lower fees through simple and unique approaches across various layers, including wallets, accounts, aggregators, infrastructure, and new standards.</p>
